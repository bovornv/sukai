# Create GitHub Repository

## Quick Steps

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/new

2. **Repository Settings**:
   - Owner: `bovornv`
   - Repository name: `ukai`
   - Description: `SukAI - Medical Triage App`
   - Visibility: Private or Public (your choice)
   - **Don't** check "Add a README file"
   - **Don't** add .gitignore or license (we already have these)

3. **Click "Create repository"**

4. **After creating, push your code**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

5. **Go back to Railway** and refresh - it will detect your code!

## Alternative: Use Railway's Empty Project

If you prefer not to use GitHub:

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Empty Project"
4. Railway will give you deployment instructions
5. You can deploy directly from your local machine using Railway CLI
